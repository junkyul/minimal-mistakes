# Introduction
We are pleased to announce an upcoming evaluation of probabilistic approximate inference algorithms, as part of the UAI
2014 conference. All researchers working on inference in graphical models and statistical relational models are
encouraged to participate.

The evaluation will focus on the following computational tasks:
* Computing the partition function and probability of evidence (PR inference)
* Computing the marginal probability distribution over a variable given evidence (MAR inference)
* Computing the most likely assignment to all variables given evidence (MAP Inference)

**Submitted algorithms can compete in some or all of these tasks.**
